# Energy Management System – Distributed Microservices Architecture

This repository contains a distributed system developed as part of the Distributed Systems course (2024–2025), Faculty of Automation and Computer Science, UTCN. The system implements a complete Energy Management System (EMS) using a modular, microservices-based architecture, and covers concepts such as REST communication, asynchronous messaging, real-time interaction, secure authentication, containerization, and deployment automation.

## Overview

The application is structured across three main assignments, each focusing on a core distributed systems concept. Together, they form a fully functional and integrated EMS platform:

- Assignment 1 – User and Device Management via REST APIs
- Assignment 2 – Asynchronous Monitoring and Real-Time Notifications using RabbitMQ and WebSockets
- Assignment 3 – Chat System with WebSocket Communication and JWT-based Authentication
- Final Integration – Deployment of all components using Docker with security and optional CI/CD
